# Unity Automated Testing Project
![Test Coverage](./CodeCoverage/Report/badge_linecoverage.png)

This project was developed as part of a technical assignment to demonstrate automated testing in Unity, using the **Endless Runner Sample Game (Trash Dash)** as the basis.

## Tested Features

- **Character Movement:** A test to ensure that the character does not move off-screen when clicking left multiple times.
- **Gaining Points by Collecting Fish:** Verifies if the player gains the correct amount of points upon collecting a fish.
- **Reset After Collisions:** Ensures that after colliding with an obstacle (e.g., sand piles), the game resets correctly and the player can start again.

## Implementation Details

- **No Modifications to Game Code:** The original game code was not altered in any way.
- **Assembly Definition:** An assembly definition file, `Game.asmdef`, was added to the `Scripts` folder to organize the test framework.
- **Test Setup and Teardown:** Tests do not rely on separate scenes inside the project folders. Instead, they use dynamic `SetUp` and `TearDown` methods to load and unload scenes as needed for each test.
- **Input Handling:** Instead of simulating input, the tests directly call the methods triggered by user input, ensuring accuracy in behavior testing.

## Limitations and Suggestions

- **Input System:** The tests were built using the old input system, even though I am aware the new Unity Input System could have been implemented. This would be a suggested improvement to modernize the input handling in future iterations of the project.

## Prerequisites

- **Unity Asset:** The [Endless Runner Sample Game](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/tutorials/endless-runner-sample-game-87901) from the Unity Asset Store.
- **Unity Editor Version:** You can use any version of the Unity Editor for this project.

## Deliverables

- Code uploaded to a Git repository.
- Video walkthrough recorded using a screen recording tool explaining the code and demonstrating the tests.

## How to Run the Tests

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Run the Playmode tests through Unityâ€™s Test Runner in the Editor. 
4. Ensure that the game runs as expected and all tests pass.
